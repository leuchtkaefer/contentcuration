***Curator Plugin***

This plugin helps you to organize Freenet data and share your collections (indexes) with others. 
Curator uses Web of Trust (WoT) identities. You can create multiple indexes for each anonymous identity that you own. 
An index is a collection of entries related to a category. For instance, you can create the categories linux and windows and mantain a collection of data related to such categories.
An entry can refer to a document or a web page in Freenet.  

***Using Curator***

The first requirement is to own at least one WoT identity. Obviously, WoT plugin is needed.
Inserting content in an index is done through any of the two available forms:
http://localhost:8888/ContentCuration/CurateWebPage
http://localhost:8888/ContentCuration/CurateFilePage

***How do I become a curator?****
 
Curate content on Freenet is way of helping others to find useful data. You can be of great help to the community when you create valuable collections. 
Keep in mind that is better to maintain a handful of collections of topics that you know well than create intractable list of collections. 
Try to become a specialist on the categories you are curating. Add tags and clear descriptions for each entry you added to the collection. 

***How do users know that I became a curator?****
After you publish an index with a WoT identity for the first time, "Curator" becomes a registered service for that identity.
Services for each identity are shown in the identity page. Check out Community menu, Known Anonymous Identities.

***Where are the indexes located?****
Indexes are published to Freenet using the publisher's key. 
The FreenetURI to download an index is a USK identical to the publisher's Request URI except for the document name and the edition number.
A publisher's Request URI ends in ".../WebOfTrust/EditionNumber", just replace it with the index's name and the appropriate edition number. 
Example ".../myCategory/5"

***How do I search content?****

To find content the search function will find keyphrases inside document's title, tags, etc.
At the moment we are working on a distributed search of the indexes. 
While the distributed search is not available, you can use the Freenet Library' search function: http://localhost:8888/library/

First you need to add the index
Name: << Choose a name you like or use the index's name
URI: <<< Put the index's FreenetURI (see Where are the indexes located)
Press "Add Bookmark" button

To selected the recently added index, just check the box and do your search. You can also search in multiple indexes.

The following are instructions to search data in Library' search:
Enter a search query into the search box, this can use the standard search engine
query syntax ( or, not/-, "") or any combination

eg
	freenet -"freenet message system"
	freenet or "free network"

Stop words( Anything less than 3 letters and popular words such as 'and' 'the'
'but' ) are excluded from searches, in some situations such as an intersection
search ('bill of rights') or phrase search('"jesus of nazareth"') the stopword
is treated as a blank as the result can still be useful, searching for
the phrase ('"the who"') will fail though as ignoring 'the' makes the search almost meaningless.
